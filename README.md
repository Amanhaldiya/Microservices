# ðŸ§© Microservices Architecture Project

A scalable and modular backend system built with Spring Boot and MongoDB, deployed using Docker and AWS. This architecture separates concerns across multiple services to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and performance.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot** â€“ RESTful microservices with separate modules for auth, user, and data processing
- **MongoDB** â€“ NoSQL database for storing user and domain data
- **Docker** â€“ Containerization for simplified deployment and scaling
- **AWS** â€“ Cloud infrastructure setup using EC2, S3, and ECS
